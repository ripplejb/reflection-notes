## SOLID Architecture Benefits

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component and service has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Services are open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Interface-based design enables easy testing and mocking
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean, focused service interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules

### Recent SOLID Compliance Improvements

The FilterService refactoring demonstrates enterprise-level SOLID compliance:

- **Extracted Business Logic**: Moved date filtering logic from UI components to dedicated service
- **Interface-Based Design**: `IFilterService` interface enables future extensibility
- **Service Container Integration**: Follows established dependency injection patterns
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests validate SOLID principle adherence
- **Documentation**: Detailed architectural documentation in `docs/SOLID-FilterService-Refactoring.md`

This refactoring ensures consistent architecture throughout the application and makes adding new filtering capabilities (tags, content search, user-based filters) straightforward without violating existing code.

## Testing

The application includes a comprehensive automated test suite covering:
- Component functionality and user interactions
- Service layer business logic and integrations
- SOLID architecture compliance and FilterService functionality
- Type safety validation
- Date range filtering operations

See `tests/README.md` for detailed testing instructions.

Quick test run:
1. Start the development server (`npm run dev`)
2. Open browser console on `http://localhost:5173/`
3. Run: `window.runReflectionNotesTests()`

Manual FilterService testing:
```bash
npx tsx tests/filter-service-test.ts
```
- **Vite 7.0.0** - Lightning-fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling with responsive design
- **Service Architecture** - Enterprise-level dependency injection pattern
- **File System Access API** - Native file operations for modern browsers
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated CI/CD pipeline
- **GitHub Pages** - Static site hosting with automatic deployment

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ **Chrome/Chromium** (recommended) - Full feature support
- ✅ **Microsoft Edge** - Full feature support  
- ⚠️ **Firefox** (limited) - File System Access API not supported, uses fallback
- ⚠️ **Safari** (limited) - File System Access API not supported, uses fallback

For browsers without File System Access API support, the application gracefully falls back to traditional file download/upload methods.
